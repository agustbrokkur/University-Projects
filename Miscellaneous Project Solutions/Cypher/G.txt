It's the tenth of January
And I still ain't had no sleep
She comes waltzing in the nighttime
Made of wings
She is dressed up like a bandit
with a hundred sparkling rings
Looking for my company to keep
Coming closer to me
She doesn't say a word
In the shadow of the carved rock tower
where the sounds of the night
were the only things we heard
In my darkest hour
