time as we know it could soon be in for a radical change
this week scientists at the royal society are discussing
whether we need to come up with a new definition of the world's
time scale
coordinated universal time
and the main issue up for debate is the leap second - and whether
we should abolish it
the leap second came into existence in 1972
it is added to keep the time-scale based on atomic clocks in phase
with the time-scale that is based on the Earth's rotation
