In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as a Caesar's cipher,
the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest
and most widely known encryption techniques.
It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext
is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
For example, with a shift of 3, A would be replaced by D,
B would become E,and so on.
The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate with
his generals.
