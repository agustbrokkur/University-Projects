Russia: Israeli threat of strikes on Iran 'a mistake'
Military action against Iran would be a "very serious mistake
fraught with unpredictable consequences", Russia's foreign minister
has warned.  Sergei Lavrov said diplomacy, not missile strikes,
was the only way to solve the Iranian nuclear problem.
His comments come after Israeli President Shimon Peres said an attack
on Iran was becoming more likely.  The UN's atomic watchdog is expected
to say this week that Iran is secretly developing a nuclear arms
capability.
